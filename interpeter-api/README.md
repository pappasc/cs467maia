# interpeter-api

## Purpose
This API addresses the fact that we cannot run LaTeX on the Standard Google AppEngine platform. This additional API will be called from employee-recognition-api and will be hosted separately on the OSU Engineering server (flip), as this server is verified to have texlive installed & python 2.7 installed.
